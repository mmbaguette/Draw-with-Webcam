# Pose Drawing

ü§è Draw with your hands by pinching your index and thumb together. 

‚úä Bend your fingers to the top of your palm, like you're closing your hand, in order to clear your drawing canvas.

[Download OBS-Studio](https://obsproject.com/ "OBS-Studio Download") in order to use the virtual camera feature, and draw during your video meetings to give visually pleasing presentations.
Once you're in a meeting, change your camera the same way you'd change your web camera in settings on your meeting app like Zoom.

## Potential updates:

- Eraser tool
- Drawing around a section to select it
- Adding images or videos from a side panel where you can drag them into your screen
- Resizing a drawing or other form of media by zooming in or out with your two hands
- Clap your hands once to publish changes and let your audience see them?
