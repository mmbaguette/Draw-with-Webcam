# Pose Drawing (with two hands!)

‚òù Stick your index and middle finger up together to draw.\
(Hands must face directly towards the camera)

You can also draw with two hands simultaneously!

[Download OBS-Studio](https://obsproject.com/ "OBS-Studio Download") in order to use the virtual camera feature, and draw during your video meetings to give visually pleasing presentations. However, a window showing your live presentation will pop up anyway.
Once you're in a meeting, change your camera the same way you'd change your web camera in settings on your meeting app like Zoom.
