# Pose Drawing

☝ Stick your index and middle finger together to draw.\
✊ Bend your drawing fingers down to clear the canvas.\
(Hands must face directly towards the camera)

[Download OBS-Studio](https://obsproject.com/ "OBS-Studio Download") in order to use the virtual camera feature, and draw during your video meetings to give visually pleasing presentations. However, a window showing your live presentation will pop up anyway.
Once you're in a meeting, change your camera the same way you'd change your web camera in settings on your meeting app like Zoom.

## Potential updates:

- Eraser tool
- Drawing around a section to select it
- Adding images or videos from a side panel where you can drag them into your screen
- Resizing a drawing or other form of media by zooming in or out with your two hands
- Clap your hands once to publish changes and let your audience see them?
